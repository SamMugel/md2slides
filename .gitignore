# INTENT (for AI):
# - Purpose: Keep local/dev artifacts out of version control for a clean repo and reproducible clones.
# - Invariants: Source code under src/ and tests/ should remain tracked; only generated or machine-local files are ignored.
# - Used by: Contributors working locally; CI; packaging workflows.
# - Safe to refactor: Yes, as long as it continues to ignore generated artifacts and does not ignore project source.
